# nightlights
Baby room Arduino night light implementations

All of these are for the Neopixel shield sold by Adafruit

http://www.adafruit.com/products/1430

The idea is that I light the shield up in different patterns,
and cover it with something that would then glow or show off
patterns on the ceiling. Currently, we use a glass fishtank
painted white, so the colors glow through. We put little
star stickers inside, and peeled them off to allow us to 
paint colored stars on the ceiling. The pinpoint ino will
do this.

Feel free to build them and use them if you would like.
